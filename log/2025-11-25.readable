User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a whisk, a ladle, a porcelain cup, a beer mug, a ceramic mug, a glass mug, a plastic cup, a paper cup, a glass, a greek yogurt cup, a vanilla yogurt cup, canned olives, olive oil, sunflower oil.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please use a mug to mix together equal parts Greek yogurt and vanilla yogurt in.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:
