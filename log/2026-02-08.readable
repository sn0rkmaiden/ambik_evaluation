User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a ladle, a mixer, a bread knife, a paring knife, a butter knife, a cutting board, sunflower oil, coconut oil, olive oil, bottled iced tea, a Pepsi can, an orange soda, a beer can, a Coca-Cola can, bottled water, a Red Bull can, a balsamic vinegar, salt, pepper.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please use the mixer to make a quick and easy vinaigrette dressing. Use a tablespoon of olive oil, a tablespoon of sunflower oil, a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix the ingredients together until well combined.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a spatula, a blender, a knife block, crackers, chocolate teacakes, an energy bar, sea salt, table salt, granulated sugar, jasmine rice, brown rice, basmati rice, parmesan, blue cheese, cheddar cheese slices, cream cheese, mozzarella sticks, cottage cheese, a paring knife, a bread knife.

We: You have received the task “Use the knife block to carefully select a sharp knife, then use it to slice the cheddar cheese slices into thin strips. Arrange the cheese strips on a plate, and microwave them for 30-45 seconds or until melted and bubbly.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

"Use the knife block to carefully select a sharp knife, then use it to slice the cheddar cheese slices into thin strips. Arrange the cheese strips on a plate, and microwave them for 30-45 seconds or until melted and bubbly."

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a grater, a spatula, a porcelain cup, a beer mug, a ceramic mug, a glass mug, a plastic cup, a paper cup, a glass, a carrot, an onion, a cabbage, a potato, a bell pepper, a cucumber, a garlic, a tomato, canned olives, an energy bar, table salt, granulated sugar, black tea bags, green tea bags.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please grate the carrot and the potato and mix them together in a bowl. Add a pinch of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil, and mix well. Use the spatula to form small patties and cook them in a pan over medium heat until they are golden brown and crispy. Serve the patties in a mug with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped green onions on top.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a toaster, a porcelain cup, a beer mug, a ceramic mug, a glass mug, a plastic cup, a paper cup, a glass, a plastic food storage container, a glass food storage container, eggs, cheddar cheese slices, cream cheese, cottage cheese, mozzarella sticks, a fresh mozzarella package, toasted bread, uncut white bread, sliced whole wheat bread, canned olives.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please make a cheese and olive toast. First, take two slices of the bread, place a slice of cheddar cheese on one of them, add a few canned olives on top, then place the second slice of bread on top, and finally toast it in the toaster until the cheese is melted.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.
