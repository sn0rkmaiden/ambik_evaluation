User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a knife block, a soup pot, a stockpot, a clean sponge, a dirty sponge, a dish soap, ketchup, tomato paste, mustard, muesli, cornflakes, bottled iced tea, a Pepsi can, a Red Bull can, a beer can, a Sprite bottle, an orange soda, a tomato.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please use the knife block to slice a tomato. Then, use the soup pot to make a quick and easy tomato soup. Use a can of tomato paste, a cup of water, and a tablespoon of mustard. Mix the ingredients together and heat over medium heat until the soup is hot.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

"Robot, please use the knife block to slice a tomato. Then, use the soup pot to make a quick and easy tomato soup. Use a can of tomato paste, a cup of water, and a tablespoon of mustard. Mix the ingredients together and heat over medium heat until the soup is hot."

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a porcelain cup, a beer mug, a ceramic mug, a glass mug, a plastic cup, a paper cup, a glass, a metal bowl, a plastic bowl, a ceramic bowl, a vegetable peeler, a potato masher, an energy bar, mixed fruit jam, sunflower oil, olive oil, a strawberry yogurt cup, a greek yogurt cup, bottled milk, butter, salt, black pepper.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please prepare mashed potatoes by cooking the peeled and chopped potatoes in salted water, straining them, and mashing them with available ingredients.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

"Robot, please prepare mashed potatoes by cooking the peeled and chopped potatoes in salted water, straining them, and mashing them with available ingredients."

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a spatula, a knife block, oven mitts, a potholder, a kitchen towel, apple pie, shepherd's pie, key lime pie, canned olives, canned corn, canned beans, canned green peas, oysters, sardines, shrimps, a seaweed, mussels, chicken nuggets, chicken balls.

We: You have received the task “Retrieve a kitchenware and take out the apple pie from the oven.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

"Retrieve a kitchenware and take out the apple pie from the oven."
