We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a potholder, a dish rack, mayonnaise, tomato paste, a bottle of white wine, a bottle of red wine, an ice cream cake, a carrot cake, a cheesecake, a chocolate cake, a strawberry cake, an energy bar, a buffalo wing, chicken balls.

We: You have received the task “Bake a chicken and vegetable casserole. In a large mixing bowl, combine a cup of diced chicken, a cup of diced vegetables (such as carrots, bell peppers, and onions), a tablespoon of tomato paste, and a tablespoon of mayonnaise. Stir the mixture until it is well-combined. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish and sprinkle a tablespoon of grated parmesan cheese over the top. Bake the casserole at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender. Serve the casserole with a slice of carrot cake on the side.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a spatula, a blender, a knife block, crackers, chocolate teacakes, an energy bar, sea salt, table salt, granulated sugar, jasmine rice, brown rice, basmati rice, parmesan, blue cheese, cheddar cheese slices, cream cheese, mozzarella sticks, cottage cheese, a paring knife, a bread knife.

We: You have received the task “Use the knife block to carefully select a sharp knife, then use it to slice the cheddar cheese slices into thin strips. Arrange the cheese strips on a plate, and microwave them for 30-45 seconds or until melted and bubbly.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

"Use the knife block to carefully select a sharp knife, then use it to slice the cheddar cheese slices into thin strips. Arrange the cheese strips on a plate, and microwave them for 30-45 seconds or until melted and bubbly."

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a metal bowl, a plastic bowl, a ceramic bowl, a garlic press, a citrus juicer, a potato, a black pepper, a bell pepper, an onion, a cucumber, a cabbage, a garlic, a carrot, an orange, a lemon, an apple, a peach, an avocado, grapes, jalapeno chips, rice chips, potato chips, table salt, sea salt, granulated sugar, uncut white bread, toasted bread, sliced whole wheat bread, eggs, cheddar cheese.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please use the frying pan to make a Western omelette. Use the knife block to chop up a bell pepper, an onion, and a tomato. Crack two eggs into a bowl and whisk them with a fork. Add the chopped vegetables to the frying pan and cook them until they are tender. Pour the eggs over the vegetables and add a slice of cheddar cheese on top. Fold the omelette in half and cook it until the cheese is melted. Serve the Western omelette with a side of sliced avocado and a slice of bread on a ceramic dinner plate.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a stainless steel tablespoon, a wooden tablespoon, a silver teaspoon, a garlic press, a ladle, a tomato, a bell pepper, a black pepper, an onion, a garlic, a cabbage, a cucumber, a potato, a carrot, granulated sugar, sea salt, table salt, mixed fruit jam.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please chop the onion, bell pepper, and tomato into small pieces using a knife, and then mix them together in a bowl with a tablespoon of granulated sugar, a teaspoon of sea salt, and a pinch of black pepper to make a simple salsa.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a toaster, a porcelain cup, a beer mug, a ceramic mug, a glass mug, a plastic cup, a paper cup, a glass, a plastic food storage container, a glass food storage container, eggs, cheddar cheese slices, cream cheese, cottage cheese, mozzarella sticks, a fresh mozzarella package, toasted bread, uncut white bread, sliced whole wheat bread, canned olives.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please make a cheese and olive toast. First, take two slices of the bread, place a slice of cheddar cheese on one of them, add a few canned olives on top, then place the second slice of bread on top, and finally toast it in the toaster until the cheese is melted.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.

{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a blender, a citrus juicer, a whisk, sea salt, table salt, grapes, a lemon, a banana, an orange, an apple, a peach, an avocado, honey.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please use the citrus juicer to squeeze the juice from a lemon. Then, use the blender to mix together a quick and easy lemon and avocado smoothie. Use a lemon, an avocado, and a tablespoon of honey.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a blender, a spatula, a whisk, mixed fruit jam, honey.

We: You have received the task “Prepare a fruity tea beverage by combining hot water with mixed fruit jam in a cup, stirring well.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a plastic food storage container, a glass food storage container, a chair, a blender, a cabbage, a carrot, a black pepper, eggs.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please make a cabbage and carrot slaw. Combine 1/2 head of cabbage, 2 carrots, 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Blend until the vegetables are finely chopped and the dressing is well combined. Transfer the slaw to a plastic food storage container and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."
