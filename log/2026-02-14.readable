User: We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is a corkscrew, a frying pan, a grill pan, a saucepan, a dish rack, tomato paste, mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard, a glass milk bottle, an oat milk bottle, mixed fruit jam, a fresh mozzarella package, cottage cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella sticks, cheddar cheese slices, a bottle of white wine, a bottle of red wine, olive oil, coconut oil, a garlic.

We: You have received the task “Robot, please use a pan to make a cheesy tomato and cream cheese dip. Heat oil in the pan over medium heat. Add garlic and cook until fragrant. Add tomato paste and cook for 1-2 minutes until darkened in color. Stir in cream cheese and cook until melted and smooth. Serve the dip in a bowl with a side of cheddar cheese slices, mozzarella sticks, and a glass of white wine.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}

We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is oven mitts, a bread knife, a paring knife, a butter knife, a cutting board, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, cherries, raspberries, eggs.

We: You have received the task “Use the cutting board and the paring knife to carefully and efficiently prepare a mixture of fruits and eggs. Bake the mixture in the oven until set and golden brown, then serve with a topping.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.



Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:



{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.

- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.



Example:

Task: "Put the red cup away."

Output:

{

  "ambiguous": true,

  "question": ["Where should I put the red cup?", "In which drawer or on the counter?"]

}



Now analyze the following task:

{

  "ambiguous": true or false,

  "question": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]

}



Formatting rules:

- Always output exactly one JSON object.

- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"question": []`.

- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.

We: You have received the task “Kitchen Robot, please make a cheese and olive toast. First, take two slices of the bread, place a slice of cheddar cheese on one of them, add a few canned olives on top, then place the second slice of bread on top, and finally toast it in the toaster until the cheese is melted.“. 

Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 

If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.
