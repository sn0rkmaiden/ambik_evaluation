We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.
We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is <DESCRIPTION>.
We: You have received the task “<TASK>“. 
Decide whether this task is ambiguous. 
If it is ambiguous, generate one or more clarifying questions that would help you perform it correctly.

Return your final answer **only** as a JSON object in the following format:

{
  "ambiguous": true or false,
  "questions": ["question 1", "question 2", ...]
}

Formatting rules:
- Always output exactly one JSON object.
- If the task is **not ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": false` and `"questions": []`.
- If the task **is ambiguous**, use `"ambiguous": true` and provide at least one question.
- Never output explanations or text outside the JSON.
- If unsure, make your best judgment and still output a valid JSON.

Example:
Task: "Put the red cup away."
Output:
{
  "ambiguous": true,
  "questions": ["Where should I put the red cup? In which drawer or on the counter?"]
}

Now analyze the following task:
"<TASK>"
