We: You are a robot operating in an office kitchen. You are in front of a counter with two closed drawers, a top one and a bottom one. There is also a landfill bin, a recycling bin, and a compost bin.
We: Apart from that, in the kitchen there is <DESCRIPTION>.
We: You have received the task “<TASK>“. 
Your goal is to decide whether this task is ambiguous and, if so, generate clarifying question(s) that would help you perform it correctly.
Respond with a single valid JSON object in this exact format:
{
  "ambiguous": <true_or_false>,
  "questions": [<list_of_clarifying_questions_if_any>]
}
Rules:
1. If the task is **not ambiguous**, set `"ambiguous": false` and `"questions": []`.
2. If the task **is ambiguous**, set `"ambiguous": true` and `"questions"` to a list of one or more clarifying questions.
3. **Never** include any other text, explanation, or commentary outside the JSON.
4. Ensure the JSON is syntactically valid and uses lowercase true/false (not capitalized).
